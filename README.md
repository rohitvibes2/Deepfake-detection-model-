# Deepfake-detection-model-
This project implements a DeepFake image detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the MesoNet (Meso4) architecture. The model is trained to classify face images as Real or Fake (DeepFake) by learning visual artifacts introduced during DeepFake generation.
